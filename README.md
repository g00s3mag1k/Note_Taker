## Description

This is a Note Taker app in Express.js that is deployed through the integrated terminal using Node.js and Heroku for an assignment from a bootcamp course I am currently enrolled in.

## Installation

Open integrated terminal under the server.js file in VS code, or a code editor of your choosing, and run 'npm i' before running the application. After that run the command 'npm run start' and click the link to the site. You can also go straight to the website through the deployed application link.

## Usage

* Notes can be written, saved, and/or deleted with this app.
